# 🎵 I Think They Call This Love — Terminal Lyrics

A minimal, aesthetic project that displays **timed song lyrics directly in the terminal**.

This repository is not about complex logic or advanced tooling — it’s about **presentation, timing, and vibe**.  
The goal is to recreate a calm, lyric-video–like experience inside a developer’s terminal.

## ✨ What This Project Does

- Displays selected song lyrics line by line
- Uses timestamps to loosely sync with the audio
- Focuses on clean terminal output and styling
- Keeps the implementation intentionally simple

This is meant to be **visual, expressive, and distraction-free**.
